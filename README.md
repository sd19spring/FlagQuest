# Flag Quest
Flag Quest is a rogue like game created to spread
awareness of LGBTQ+ identities by integrating the elements
of LGBTQ+ flags into fun puzzles. As the game’s player, you
wander through the dark, navigating around or overcoming
obstacles to collect the different colors of your identity.
As you collect each flag, you’ll learn more about the
history of the flag and the identity that it represents.
